        Do you believe in butterfly theory? We do. A simple action could result in a huge outcome. And we have
        embarked on a journey in pursuit of unearthing the lost treasure and make it available to all of us around
        us. We specialize in premium and ancient varieties of rice and rapidly expanding our enriching food produce.
        From tens of thousands of varieties of rice, we have been limited a rice that are nameless, odorless and
        tasteless. It is our mission to promote the lesser known ancient traditional varieties that come with a load
        of nutrients, to name a few – Mapillai Samba, Karuppu Kavuni, Kaatu Yaanam, Poongar, Kullakar, Kichili Samba,
        Seeraga Samba, Ponni.

        We are proud farmers ourselves and we are closely associated with a larger community of farmers. We directly
        source our produce from 300+ farmers cutting down several layers of middle men. Thus, we ensure that our farmers
        get the right price while we deliver the right produce to the customers.

        Quite like the wine that gets better with time, rice becomes healthier, tastier and fluffier with age. Our
        paddy is stored for about a year in pristine conditions, before it hits the mills!

        We source Ponni from the paddy ﬁelds that are nurtured by the opulently fertile soil along the banks of
        Cauvery. It really does matter where a crop grows. We source the varieties from where it grows the best.
        Our produce filters through several process checks that ensures quality all the way from the selection of
        the ﬁnest seeds to storing the harvested paddy in pristine conditions.
